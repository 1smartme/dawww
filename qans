✅ Virtualization and Its Types – Explained Clearly
💡 What is Virtualization?
Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual version of something—such as a computer system, server, storage device, or network—using software, rather than a physical version.
It allows multiple virtual systems to run on a single physical machine, sharing its resources (CPU, memory, storage) efficiently.

📌 Why Virtualization?
Saves hardware cost
Improves resource utilization
Supports testing and development
Enables disaster recovery
Allows isolation of applications and services

🔰 Main Types of Virtualization
Type	Description	Example Tools
1. Hardware Virtualization	Creating virtual machines (VMs) on physical hardware using a hypervisor	VMware, VirtualBox, KVM
2. Operating System Virtualization	Running multiple OS instances on a single kernel	Docker, LXC (Linux Containers)
3. Server Virtualization	Dividing a physical server into multiple virtual servers	VMware ESXi, Hyper-V
4. Storage Virtualization	Pooling physical storage from multiple devices into a single virtual device	IBM SAN Volume Controller
5. Network Virtualization	Combining network resources to act as a single virtual network	Cisco ACI, VMware NSX
6. Application Virtualization	Running apps in isolated containers, without installing on the host OS	Citrix, Microsoft App-V
7. Desktop Virtualization	Hosting user desktops on central servers and accessing via thin clients	VMware Horizon, Citrix XenDesktop

🧠 Quick Definitions
Hypervisor: Software that enables virtualization by separating the OS from hardware.

Type 1 (Bare Metal): Runs directly on hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi, Hyper-V)
Type 2 (Hosted): Runs on top of an OS (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware Workstation)
VM (Virtual Machine): A software-based emulation of a physical computer.

Container: A lightweight unit for packaging applications with dependencies, using OS-level virtualization (e.g., Docker).
